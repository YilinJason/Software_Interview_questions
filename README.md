## Java Basics

### 1. What is the difference between an interface and an Abstract class (接口和抽象类的区别)
  
   - An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods but interface can contains only abstract method.
   - An abstract class can have all four (static, non-static and final, non-final variables) but interface only can have
     static variables
   - Abstract class supports kmultiple inheritance but interface does not.
   - Abstract class has class members like private and protected, etc but interface has class members publis by default.
   
### 2. What is the difference between a constructor and a method? (构造函数和方法的区别)

   - A constructor is a block of code that initializes a newly created object and method is a collection of statement which       returns a value upon its execution.
   - A constructor can be used to initialize an object and a method consists of Java code to be executed
   - A constructor doesn'thave a return type but a method must have a return type
   - Constructor initializes a object that doesn't exist but method does operations on an already created object.
   - A constructor's name must be same as the name of the class but method's name can be anything.
   - Constructor cannot be inherited by subclasses but method can be inherited by subclasses
   
### 3. State the significance of public, private, protected, default modifiers both singly and in combination and state the 
        effect of package relationships on declared items qualified by these modifiers.
